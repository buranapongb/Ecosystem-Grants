## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
    - Band Protocol is a leading cross-chain data oracle provider that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts.
- A brief description of the template building.
    - BandChain is based on Cosmos SDK, designed to be compatible with all smart contract platforms and blockchain development frameworks. In a trustless and decentralized manner, BandChain does all the heavy lifting jobs of pulling data from external sources, aggregating, and packaging them into a format that is easy to use and cryptographically verified across multiple blockchains. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, BandChain is designed explicitly for oracle data requests and computation. Data request transactions are both received and resolved very quickly. Furthermore, our data source scripts and oracle scripts allow maximum customization and flexibility for the user to query and compute their desired data feed.
- An indication of how your project relates to ink! ecosystem.
    - Band Protocol has the potential to become a crucial infrastructure provider for the ink! Ecosystem. As projects develop on Astar, they will require reliable oracle services to deliver precise real-world data, and VRF to produce randomized results in their gaming and lottery mechanisms. By integrating with Astar, we can prepare and offer these essential services to Dapps building on the platform. Additionally, developers can be assured that they will receive high-quality data from a team of experienced professionals managing the price feed. By leveraging Band Protocol's expertise, Astar can enhance its offerings and provide a more comprehensive, reliable ecosystem for its users. Furthermore, we have a strong track record of collaborating with and offering oracle solutions for astar for more than a year now. This extensive experience positions us as a knowledgeable and skilled team in supporting the polkadot ecosystem and we are truly enthusiastic about continuing our involvement to its growth.
- Choosen project idea category or your alternative category with explanation of its importance
    - Band Protocol's decentralized oracle solutions provide critical infrastructure for blockchain networks to access external data and integrate it into their smart contracts and decentralized applications. This enables blockchain networks to become more powerful and versatile, creating new opportunities for developers and users alike.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
    - Astar has a robust foundation and ecosystem, making it an attractive platform for many talented builders to develop on in the near future. Our team has been integrated with Astar EVM for over a year now, and we’ve already requested our technical team review the technical specifications and documentation of Astar Wasm. Our team has significant experience integrating with EVM, WASM, and Rust-based projects, which gives us the expertise needed to provide excellent services for dapps looking to build on Astar Wasm. By leveraging our technical know-how, we are confident that we can provide strong support to developers building on the Astar Wasm platform.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

Please clearly describe how exactly your project will benefit the ecosystem. If it's infrastructure - how it's going to be applied and by who. If it's canary dapp we would you to clearly demonstrate how this code will be used by other people. If it's technical showcase we would like you to demonstrate how ink! will be promoted using your results. 

If it's a business case we would like to see business model and future production plans. 

- Band Protocol offers a wide range of real-world data services, including cryptocurrency prices, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. Our services are currently available on 19 chains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Cronos. We have also integrated with various projects on their testnets to ensure seamless data delivery. We have collaborated with lending, perpetual, yield protocols and more to provide accurate and reliable data that supports a variety of use cases. By partnering with Band Protocol, Dapps can access the data they need to build innovative and secure blockchain applications that meet the needs of their users.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
- Do you need an audit for the contacts? **YES/NO**
(don’t add it as part of Milestones! The auditor will be chosen among Auditor track participants)
- CATEGORY: Infrastructure OR Canary Dapp OR Technical Showcase


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application:
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Bounty Program?** Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.
- As we have already integrated with Astar EVM, we maintain regular communication with their team. Recently, Toma, the head of Wasm Initiatives, informed us about this program, and we are extremely keen to participate.

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:
- Here's our Band Standard Dataset: https://data.bandprotocol.com/
    - For our Band Protocol’s flagship Oracle product, we have undergone a quality assurance process in which the listing criteria has been improved to provide more security to Band’s customers and end users. Symbols listed on the Band Standard Dataset are those that have been verified and passed several criteria
- Here's our Band Partners website: https://www.bandpartners.io/
    - In addition to providing our statistics, including total value secured (TVS), total requests, and data requests, our website showcases the various DeFi projects we have collaborated with in the past and the blockchain networks on which we are already integrated.
- Here's our Cosmoscan: https://www.cosmoscan.io/
    - Cosmosscan provides an accessible platform for everyone to effortlessly monitor and analyze the latest real-time blocks, requests, and transactions on BandChain. Additionally, users can access valuable information about our validators, datasources, and oracle scripts, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the BandChain ecosystem.
